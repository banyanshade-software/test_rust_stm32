# test_rust_stm32

This repo is an experiment of RUST on STM32 target (STM32G491 Nucleo Board)
Several experimentations are performed here, on several branches

* 01_minimal_setup

  this setup is based on http://blackforrest-embedded.de/2024/05/01/rust-and-vendor-sdksii/
  Rust is only a static library, with (for now) no specific stm32 crates, called from C


  * 02_test_panic
